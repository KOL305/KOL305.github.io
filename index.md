For the 2023 Congressional App Challenge, built a web application designed to help homeowners reduce energy usage by informing users of their energy generation and consumption patterns. Users can see daily energy usage and consumption statistics on their dashboard, using LightGBM Gradient-boosting Decision Trees to make regression predictions to help users see predicted energy usage. OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo is used to generate energy-saving recommendations tailored to the user's energy usage distribution, and homeowners can see predicted energy-saving statistics to continue being mindful of their energy consumption.

For the 2023 San Ramon Hackathon (3rd Place Winner), built a web-based fishery simulator that taught players the dangers and causes of overfishing through managing their own fishery. Random in-game events, such as rapid eutrophication, would cause players to decide between overfishing their pond or being unable to pay rent. Instructional messages accompanied events to reinforce the learning experience.
